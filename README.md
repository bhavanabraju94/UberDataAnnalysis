ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains lab exercises and analysis tasks related to Big Data Analytics (BDA) using Python. The notebook demonstrates the use of popular data processing and analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore, clean, and visualize datasets relevant to big data applications.

ðŸ”§ Technologies & Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas â€“ for data wrangling and manipulation

NumPy â€“ for numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ for visualizations

ðŸ“Š What Youâ€™ll Find Inside
Data preprocessing: loading, cleaning, handling nulls

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations: histograms, bar charts, line plots

Time series or categorical analysis (based on dataset)

Optional: correlation, grouping, or feature-based analysis

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
Apply Python for analyzing large-scale datasets

Gain hands-on experience with BDA tools

Extract meaningful patterns and trends from raw data
